# Pac-Man-Web-game

A simple Pac-Man Web game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Created during my journey of learning Frontend Development.

### The Game
Pac-Man is a 1980 maze action video game developed and released by Namco for arcades. 
The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while
avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" 
causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.

### Project Sumary:
The game is created with the usage of the DOM elements - each cell in the grid is a <div> element. 
The logic for movement and collisons in the project is done by adding and removing css classes to the
<div> grid elements.
